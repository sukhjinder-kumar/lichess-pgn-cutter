lichess-pgn-cutter:->
In this python code , you can enter your pgn file name and divide it into smaller pgn cantaining lesser variations mainly for uploading on lichess.
Just download this code, change the name of path (a code variable , make it equal to pgn name) and put x as whatever your desired size is (for lichess it's 30, 
though they say 20, but 30 also works) and than run the code. enjoy:) 
(Note: you must have python installed on your device, no libaries required though)
